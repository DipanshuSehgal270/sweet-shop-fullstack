# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.



# 🥨 Bikaner Sweets - Frontend

A modern, responsive Single Page Application (SPA) for an e-commerce sweet shop. This interface allows users to browse traditional Indian sweets, manage a shopping cart, and simulate secure payments, while providing a comprehensive dashboard for Administrators to manage inventory.

> **Note:** This frontend interacts with a custom-built **Spring Boot Backend** running on Port 8080.

## 🧠 Development Methodology & AI Integration

This project was built using a hybrid development approach, leveraging Generative AI as a productivity multiplier while maintaining strict human oversight on core architectural logic.

### 🎨 Frontend: AI-Accelerated Development
The frontend was **architected and generated by AI** to simulate a rapid-prototyping environment. The goal was to instantly visualize backend data without spending excessive time on UI boilerplate.
* **Component Architecture:** AI was used to design the React component hierarchy (Pages vs. Components) and enforce separation of concerns.
* **State Management:** The Context API logic for the Shopping Cart and Authentication state was synthesized by AI to ensure efficient prop-drilling avoidance.
* **Styling & UX:** The "SaaS-style" CSS, responsive layouts, and interactive elements (hover effects, payment modals) were generated to achieve a professional aesthetic immediately.

### ⚙️ Backend: Human-Led Engineering with AI Support
The Spring Boot backend was **designed, coded, and secured manually** by the developer, with AI serving as an intelligent assistant for specific tasks:
* **Test Driven Development (TDD):** AI was utilized to generate comprehensive **JUnit 5 and Mockito test cases**, ensuring high code coverage for Services and Controllers.
* **Boilerplate Reduction:** AI assisted in scaffolding the initial project structure and generating standard CRUD boilerplate code.
* **Query Optimization:** Complex JPQL and Custom SQL queries (e.g., for the Search/Filtering logic) were refined with AI suggestions for performance.
* **Security Configuration:** AI assisted in debugging specific CORS and CSRF configurations within the Spring Security 6 filter chain.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 👤 User Features
* **Hero Landing Page:** Professional entrance with trust badges and brand storytelling.
* **Smart Dashboard:**
    * **Trending Now:** Automatically highlights top-selling items based on sales data.
    * **Search:** Real-time filtering by sweet name.
    * **Stock Indicators:** Visual badges for "In Stock" vs "Sold Out".
* **Shopping Cart:**
    * Global state management using **Context API**.
    * Persistent cart (saved in LocalStorage).
    * Removal and summary calculation.
* **Simulated Checkout:** A realistic "Fake Payment" modal with spinning loaders and validation.

### 🛡️ Admin Features
* **Role-Based Access:** Admin-only buttons are hidden from normal users.
* **Inventory Management:**
    * **Add Item:** Upload names, prices, categories, and images.
    * **Edit Item:** Update prices or fix descriptions instantly.
    * **Delete Item:** Remove products with confirmation.
    * **User Management:** Promote standard users to Admins.
